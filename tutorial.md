# How to Run a Blockchain Node? ðŸ¤”

At first glance, running a blockchain node may seem overwhelming, but the process is surprisingly straightforward once broken down. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to help you get started.


## Understand the mechanism 

A blockchain node is essentially a computer that participates in the blockchain network by maintaining a copy of the blockchain ledger, validating transactions, and sometimes producing new blocks. Nodes can serve different purposes:

- **Full Nodes**: Store the entire blockchain and validate transactions.
- **Light Nodes**: Store only a portion of the blockchain for faster performance.
- **Validator Nodes**: Participate in consensus mechanisms, such as Proof-of-Stake or Proof-of-Authority.


## Hardware Requirements ðŸ’»

Running a blockchain node requires hardware that can handle the demands of constant communication, computation, and storage. Hereâ€™s what youâ€™ll typically need:

- **Processing Power**: A modern CPU, ideally quad-core or higher.
- **RAM**: At least 8GB (16GB+ recommended for demanding blockchains).
- **Storage**: Depending on the blockchain, storage needs range from a few gigabytes (light nodes) to terabytes (full nodes like Bitcoin).
- **Internet Connection**: A stable, high-speed internet connection is essential for syncing the blockchain and communicating with peers.

Some blockchains, like Bitcoin, require terabytes of storage for the entire blockchain! ðŸ¤¯

For this tutorial, we will install an [Ethereum](https://ethereum.org/en/) node. Ethereum nodes are an excellent starting point as they provide access to a smart contract platform while offering various node types.
